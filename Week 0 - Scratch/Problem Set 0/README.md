Details of Assignment:
It’s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch.

Requirements:
Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivy’s Hardest Game.



Details of Project:
A simple game where the player catches falling fruit (apples and oranges) before they hit the ground.
The player gains a point for each fruit caught and placed in the correct bowl.
The player losses a point for each fruit hitting the ground or for putting the fruit in the incorrect bowl.
The player is able to move the fruit by clicking and dragging the fruit with their mouse cursor.
